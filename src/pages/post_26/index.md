Mobile Devices and Personal PCs are as useless as anything if there are no software updates. A human body is somehow useless if there are no updates in your ideology, philosophies about life, yourself and other people around you. And more importantly your perception of what success is and the process of achieving your goals and dreams.

Sitting in the middle of the night and seeing myself as a mobile device— my brain is my software which needs constant features updates and OS versions. There have to be some reasons why you need constant updates to stay relevant and much appealing to yourself and many other people around you.

We, humans, have to be constantly updating our software (brain) on multiple things and adding new features and security patches with good UI(because appearance tells how people should address you)— this is how we can be valuable to different users and stay relevant as time passes by.

Our goal as a human is to constantly update ourselves on multiple things and if you are not constantly contradicting yourself, you are not growing.
