A new decade is about to begin and there are several possibilities to unlock, building embedded devices over years and having built several deep learning applications I see soon the era of dormant devices would phase out and we are entering a decade with a whole lot of opportunities to unlock at the Interceptions of embedded devices and machine learning.

With the arrival of Ok google which run some neural networks at the edge to unlock new product possibilities and several applications contexts , every organization needs to have a deep Insight on the new era of technology possibilities.

AI has moved beyond the academia and with several pre-trained models, many organizations can leverage on transfer learning to unlock several opportunities in the new era of technology advances. The computation power is on the rise daily and battery technology is getting better, several frameworks like Google tensorflow-lite, NVIDIA TensorRT and Intel Corporation OpenVINO toolkit can help with Model optimization to achieve a small model that can run Inferences on embedded chips.
