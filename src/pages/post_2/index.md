```
check out some of the machinelearning limitations and how to get around it.
```

- **Model interpretability and Transparency:**
  There are tons of Explanable AI models packages out there that can help explain the black box using SHAP, LIME, ELI5 etc

- **Bias in data and Algorithms:**
  Bias in data can be carefully dealt with using proper annotations, quality data, and Algorithms bias can be navigated through by using the right algorithm for the task.

- **Unexpected outcomes and predictions:**
  Unexpected outcome and predictions are often more from data points available and less monitoring of model during production in which some Data points used in training the model might have been pulled out of the database. “Machine unlearning “ would help more with this.
