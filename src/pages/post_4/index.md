Innovation = Creativity + Commercialization.

“Anyone who doesn’t learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.”

I’m a big fan of Nicholas Tesla and despite his very creative we are unable to attribute most of his Inventions to him simply because he didn’t commercialized them.

One thing is to be creative and another part is to ensure it get commercialized for people to appreciate the creativity and get the benefits.

As every organization is planning their Innovation process for 2020, they should check if it can be commercialized and the most important aspect is if the timing is right?

Timing play an important role between a failed Innovation and successful ones.

Stay Blessed and have a prosperous new year.
