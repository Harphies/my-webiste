Why many people still believe _machinelearning_ is all about mapping input to output, the untold truth and the most exciting area of #artificialintelligence gaining more attention recently and powering the greatest applications in the field is #reinforcementlearning .

Reinforcement Learning is so powerful that your agent can learn on their own in a particular environment which they have a reward or punishment based on the policy.

The beauty of the environment the agent Learn from is that it’s dynamic and that’s what makes it unique, while other #machinlearning technologies require training the model with the data within the domain of usage and any data outside of the domain has to undergone some transfer learning by abstracting some layers to ensure it works really well with the model.

I see more prospects with reinforcement learning especially in the healthcare Industry and one of the most exciting areas of research for me recently is how we can help solve the problem of “treatment policies” in the Health Industry.

We can create an agent that learn the optimal treatment policies in a dynamic hospital environments.
